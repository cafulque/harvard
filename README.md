Final Project - HarvardX CS50x
CS50's Introduction to Computer Science
Programmer: Carlos Fulqueris

This repository contains my final project for HarvardX CS50x - CS50's
Introduction to Computer Science, developed individually in Java.
The project applies core computer science concepts and demonstrates object-oriented programming with classes, objects, and collections.

Features

 •	Object-Oriented Design: Implementation of multiple classes with attributes, constructors, and methods.
 •	Collections: Use of Java collections to organize and manipulate data.
 •	Console Input: Program accepts arguments from the command line, with a default handled through a Path.
 •	Accessors and Mutators: Includes getters and setters; some are not currently used but were generated to support future development and scalability.

•	SQL Version (v2.9):

  o	Version 2.9 is dedicated to SQL-related features.
  o	It introduces conceptual SQL statements, meant to illustrate how a database layer could be integrated.
  o	These statements remain conceptual only, as some database-related classes were incomplete or not fully covered in the course.
  o	For clarification, see the explanation included at the end of the MAIN class.

Notes

  •	This project emphasizes fundamentals of computer science and Java programming rather than full-stack implementation.
  •	The SQL components (v2.9) serve as a conceptual demonstration and are not connected to a database.

Upgrades

•	I faced difficulties due to my limited knowledge of some programming tools.
•	I had problems with the IDE, including understanding its installation, APIs, and extensions.
•	I tried to acquire additional knowledge through other sources, such as YouTube courses.
•	I initially uploaded partial versions of the project to meet submission deadlines.
•	These versions were functional but did not fully meet my expectations.
•	Later, I deleted them to keep only the final version, ensuring it was functional.
•	I started with version 1.1.0 and finished with version 3.2.0, which includes processes with CSV files and handling of SQL Server tables.
•	Much of what I implemented was based on knowledge I had from other programming languages.
