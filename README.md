Final Project – HarvardX CS50x
CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my final project for HarvardX CS50x - CS50's
Introduction to Computer Science, developed individually in Java.
The project applies core computer science concepts and demonstrates object-oriented programming with classes, objects, and collections.

Features
•	Object-Oriented Design: Implementation of multiple classes with attributes, constructors, and methods.
•	Collections: Use of Java collections to organize and manipulate data.
•	Console Input: Program accepts arguments from the command line, with a default handled through a Path.
•	Accessors and Mutators: Includes getters and setters; some are not currently used but were generated to support future development and scalability.
•	SQL Version (v2.9):
o	Version 2.9 is dedicated to SQL-related features.
o	It introduces conceptual SQL statements, meant to illustrate how a database layer could be integrated.
o	These statements remain conceptual only, as some database-related classes were incomplete or not fully covered in the course.
o	For clarification, see the explanation included at the end of the MAIN class.

Notes
•	This project emphasizes fundamentals of computer science and Java programming rather than full-stack implementation.
•	The SQL components (v2.9) serve as a conceptual demonstration and are not connected to a database.
